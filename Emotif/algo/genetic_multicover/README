#This code uses the MOEA framework which has several implementations of evolutionary algorithms.
http://moeaframework.org/

#How to compile
javac -cp ".:/home/rami/Documents/moea/MOEAFramework-2.4/lib/*" Motif_select_example.java 

#How to run (this is using an example in the data folder):
#Note that you need to provide your path to the MOEA framework
java -cp ".:/home/rami/Documents/moea/MOEAFramework-2.4/lib/*" Motif_select_example test ../data/stress_moea.conf


#Notes

The number of contraints and number of objectives is hard coded as well in 'Motif_select-example.java' file:
inData.setNumObjectives(3);
inData.setNumConstraints(4);

For PNPSMC the depth and min_pos_cov are hard coded:
The max_depth option is hard coded for now in the 'Motif_select.java' file:
//the max depth, for now it is hard coded 
int maxDepth = 3; 

The min positive coverage for every motif is hard coded in the 'Motif_select.java' file:
double minMotifPosCov = 0.5; //Constriant for min pos coverage per single motif in percentage
